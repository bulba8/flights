# flights
A shiny app for flights in the USA in 2015. The flights data can be downloaded in https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays, since it's quite large, it's not possible to put it in github directly. The app can be seen running https://alinepelegrino.shinyapps.io/flights/ . Due to the size of the data, it can take a while for the page to load completely.
